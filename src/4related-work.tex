\section{Related Work}

In 2009, Chen\cite{b6} innovatively proposed the application of crowdsourced technology to QoE (quality of experience) testing. In 2012, Liu et al.\cite{b7} and others have combined crowdsourced testing with usability testing. The results show that crowdsourced usability testing can significantly reduce testing costs, but the quality of crowdsourced availability is slightly lower than traditional usability testing. In 2013,Komarov\cite{b8} compared the crowdsourced GUI test with the traditional laboratory test, and evaluated the experimental results from the results of differential distribution, task completion time, error rate and consistency, and the feasibility of crowdsourced GUI test. That is, crowdsourced technology can effectively carry out GUI testing. From this point of view, most of the crowdsourced test optimization work proposed by researchers focuses on the processing methods of test reports, and the imperfect crowdsourced mechanism leads to heavy post-processing work. Based on this situation, this paper proposes an optimization mechanism of crowdsourced testing process for the first time, which improves the management mode of crowdsourced workers and optimizes the allocation of testing tasks.
