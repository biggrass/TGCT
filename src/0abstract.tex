Nowadays, Android testing is becoming more and more challenging, crowdsourced testing is introduced in this area. However, because of the unsupervised testing process, the quality of crowdsourced testing needs to be improved urgently. Inspired by "collective intelligence", this article proposes a framework named TGCT, which combined with crowdsourced testing and automated testing. This framework contains three main usages. Firstly, TGCT takes the exception triggered by the automated test as the test case, and uses the uncovered test case based on the static code analysis as the supplement. Secondly, TGCT realizes the personalized recommender for test cases to allocate different test tasks for different crowd workers, which is based on the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Thirdly, TGCT provides real-time guidance for crowd workers to reproduces the exceptions or triggers new exceptions. Further, we carried out crowdsourced testing controlled experiment in three real Android applications, and analyzed the test results, proving that the framework proposed in this paper can effectively improve the quality of the crowdsourced test.
