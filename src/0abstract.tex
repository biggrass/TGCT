Nowadays, Android testing is becoming more and more challenging, crowdsourcing testing came into being. However, because of the unsupervised testing process, the quality of crowdsourcing testing needs to be improved urgently. Inspired by "collective intelligence", this article proposes a tool named TGCT, which combined with crowdsourcing testing and automated testing. This tool contains three main usages. Firstly, this tool will take the exception triggered by the automated test as the test case. Secondly, according to the static analysis of the program source code, this tool finds the uncovered test case. Thirdly, based on the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, TGCT implements a recommendation system for test cases to allocate different testing tasks for different crowd workers. Further, we carried out a crowdsourcing test comparison experiment in three real Android applications, and analyzed the test results, proving that the mechanism proposed in this paper can effectively improve the quality of crowdsourcing test.
