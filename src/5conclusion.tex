\section{Conclusion}
% Crowdsourcing is gradually applied to the field of software testing with its low cost, high return and fast iteration. However, traditional crowdsourcing testing has some problems such as crowd workers being unable to collaborate because of their pool professional skill. Therefore, effectively managing the process of crowdsourced testing and the guidance for crowd workers is significant.
This paper proposes an improved crowdsourced testing mechanism, which helps to guide crowd workers to work better. Firstly, TGCT builds the GUI model based on automated testing and static analysis. Secondly, collecting the historical test behavior of crowd workers, TGCT implements a collaborative test task recommendation module to optimizes resource allocation and improves overall test efficiency. Thirdly, when the crowd worker selects a test task, the TGCT calculates the transition path to guide the crowd workers performance test tasks in real time. We experimented on the three applications of "Jiandou", "QQ Video" and "Record". From two aspects: test efficiency and exceptions coverage, it is proved that our guidance mechanism can effectively improve the quality of crowdsourced test.
